- 👋 Hi, I’m Aylee Wu
- 👀 Welcome to my page where I share all my exciting coding, engineering, and art projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently an Electrical Engineering Major and CS Secondary Major (Minor in Art Practice) @ Stanford!
- 💞️ I’m looking to share my projects, look for future work, and get involved with the creative communities.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love carrying this little 33 Ω resistor on me. It was the first resistor I've ever used in lab, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life.

Some of my favorite projects include using Max MSP to create a personal live VJing setup (DJing but with video installations). I was able to perform at CCRMA at Stanford using a keyboard synced to various programs that distorted and altered video, sound, and the live camera.

One of my greatest passions is electrical engineering -- especially developing hardware that is "carbon-efficient" and an effective alternative to semiconducting materials for batteries, transistors, and more. I'm interested in carbon nanotube transistor research (CNFETs), hardware verification, FPGA programming, and embedded systems.
