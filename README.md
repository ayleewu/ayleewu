- ⚡ Fun fact: I love carrying this little 33 Ω resistor on me. It was the first resistor I've ever used in lab, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life.

Some of my favorite projects include using Max MSP to create a personal live VJing setup (DJing but with video installations). I was able to perform at CCRMA at Stanford using a keyboard synced to various programs that distorted and altered video, sound, and the live camera.
