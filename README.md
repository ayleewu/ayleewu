- 👋 Hi, I’m Aylee Wu
- 👀 Welcome to my page where I share all my exciting coding, engineering, and art projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently an Electrical Engineering Major and CS Secondary Major (Minor in Art Practice) @ Stanford!
- 💞️ I’m looking to share my projects, look for future work, and get involved with the creative communities.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love carrying this little 33 Ω resistor on me. It was the first resistor I've ever used in lab, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life.

Some of my favorite projects include using Max MSP and jitter to create a personal live VJing setup (DJing but with video installations). I was able to perform at CCRMA at Stanford using a keyboard synced to various programs that distorted and altered video, sound, and the live camera. I was able to combine my graphic design, video installation, and world-building skills from Art Practice with my programming skills.

On top of combining computer science with art practice, electrical engineering is one of my greatest passions. Stanford Solar Car Project is a student organization focused on designing and constructing a racing vehicle solely dependent on solar energy. We race the car every summer and tackle real-life problem-solving to optimize the speed and power consumption of the car. Learning to be better at developing circuit schematics, creating PCB designs, and debugging more efficiently are some of my greatest goals -- in hopes of creating more carbon-efficient and time-efficient hardware.
